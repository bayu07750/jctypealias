# jctypealias

## About
When I write apps using Jetpack Compose, I often find myself writing callbacks or lambdas from low-level to high-level composables. I realized that this could be simplified by creating a typealias for myself. This helped me to reduce the amount of callback writing and made my code faster to write. I decided to share this improvement by creating a repository that other developers can use.
